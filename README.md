Welcome to our full-stack Django e-commerce project! Our platform is a fully functional e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process.
Our project uses Django, a high-level Python web framework, for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. We also use PostgreSQL for the database to ensure data is stored securely.

What sets our e-commerce project apart is its user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation. We have designed the website to be easy to use and understand for all types of users, whether they are tech-savvy or not.
